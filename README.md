# localstorage-exercise

Imagine it's your first day on the job and you've been tasked with integrating local storage into an application you've never seen before. Specifically, you'll need to persist the user's favorite cars as a single item in local storage.

Fortunately, the application is already built and allows a user to favorite cars. It just doesn't persist them to local storage yet. The state of the user's favorite cars is stored in the following data model.

```javascript
const favorites = {
  CAR_ID1: true,
  CAR_ID2: false
};
```

Good luck!
